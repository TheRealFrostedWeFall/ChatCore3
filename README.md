ChatCore 3 Skript | Public and BETA Releases


ChatCore formerly known as FrostChat is a fully more stable upgraded and better maintained fork of FrostChat. soon as FrostChat was my first skript I did not have much experience with coding / skripting and because of that the code was very messy, untidy and was not maintained very well.

My aim with ChatCore 2.0 is to maintain this better and have more features to make it replicate ChatControl and possibly be one of the best Chat Core / Control skript / plugins on Spigot.
